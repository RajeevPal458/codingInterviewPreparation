# You can also learn about the "Show Me" feature, which suggests the best visualization type based on the data you select.
#
#   4. **Using Filters and Parameters**: Filters allow you to focus on specific data points in your visualizations. Learn how to use filters to narrow down your data and create more meaningful insights.
# Parameters allow users to input values that can change the behavior of calculations and filters. Learn how to create and use parameters in Tableau.

#
# 5. **Creating Dashboards**: Dashboards are collections of multiple visualizations that provide a comprehensive view of your data. Learn how to create and customize dashboards, add interactivity, and arrange visualizations for better storytelling.
# You can also learn about using actions to create interactivity between different visualizations on the dashboard.

#
# 6. **Creating Stories**: Tableau allows you to create stories that combine visualizations and text to convey a narrative. Learn how to create stories in Tableau and use them to present your findings effectively.
#
# 7. **Sharing and Publishing**: Once you have created your visualizations and dashboards, you can share them with others. Learn how to publish your work to Tableau Server or Tableau Public, and understand the differences between the two.
# You can also learn about exporting visualizations as images or PDFs for offline sharing.
