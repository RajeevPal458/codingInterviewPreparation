# 1. Calculate the mean of each feature:
#    mean = (1 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 3.0
#    mean = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4.0
# 2. Calculate the standard deviation of each feature:
#    std = sqrt(((1 - 3)^2 + (3 - 3)^2 + (5 - 3)^2) / (3 - 1)) = sqrt(4 / 2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414
#    std = sqrt(((2 - 4)^2 + (4 - 4)^2 + (6 - 4)^2) / (3 - 1)) = sqrt(4 / 2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414
# 3. Standardize each feature using the formula: z = (x - mean) / std
#    For the first feature:
#    z1 = (1 - 3) / 1.414 ≈ -1.414

# use of simpleImputer library explain in details
# SimpleImputer is a preprocessing technique in machine learning that is used to handle missing values in a dataset. It provides a simple and efficient way to impute missing values by replacing them with a specified value, such as the mean, median, or mode of the feature. SimpleImputer is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have missing values, as it allows us to fill in the gaps and ensure that the data is complete and usable for modeling. By using SimpleImputer, we can effectively handle missing values and improve the performance of machine learning models.
# SimpleImputer is commonly used in conjunction with other preprocessing techniques, such as StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, to ensure that all features are in a suitable format for modeling. It can also be used in combination with other imputation techniques, such as KNN imputation or regression imputation, to provide a more robust solution for handling missing values. Overall, SimpleImputer is a powerful tool for preprocessing data and improving the performance of machine learning models.
# It is also useful for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). By imputing missing values, we can ensure that all features are complete and usable for modeling, which can improve the convergence of optimization algorithms and reduce overfitting. SimpleImputer can also help to improve the interpretability of the model by providing a clear representation of the missing values and their relationships with the target variable. Overall, SimpleImputer is a powerful tool for preprocessing data and improving the performance of machine learning models.

# Example of using SimpleImputer with the given dataset

# Convert the dataset to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Introduce some missing values for demonstration
df.loc[0, 'plas'] = None # Missing value in 'plas' column
df.loc[2, 'skin'] = None # Missing value in 'skin' column
df.loc[4, 'test'] = None # Missing value in 'test' column
df.loc[1, 'mass'] = None # Missing value in 'mass' column

print("Original DataFrame with missing values:")
print(df.head())

# 1. SimpleImputer with mean strategy
mean_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean', missing_values=np.nan)
df_mean_imputed = df.copy()
transformed_data = mean_imputer.fit_transform(df_mean_imputed.iloc[:, :-1])
#df_mean_imputed.iloc[:, :-1] = transformed_data[:, :-1]  # Ensure the shapes match
df_mean_imputed.iloc[:, :-1] = transformed_data
print("\nDataFrame after mean imputation:")
print(df_mean_imputed.head())

# Explain me this mean stategy how it works step by step
# 1. Calculate the mean of each feature (column) in the dataset, ignoring the missing values.
#    For example, for the 'plas' column, the mean is calculated as:
#    mean_plas = (148 + 85 + 183 + 89 + 137 + 116 + 78 + 115 + 197 + 125 + 110 + 140 + 130 + 99 + 120 + 100 + 95 + 105 + 143 + 129) / 19 = 122.68
#    (Note: The missing value is ignored in the calculation)
# 2. Replace the missing values in each feature with the calculated mean.
#    For the 'plas' column, the missing value at index 0 is replaced with the mean value:
#    df_mean_imputed.loc[0, 'plas'] = mean_plas = 122.68
# 3. Repeat the process for all features with missing values.

# iloc[:, :-1] means - select all rows and all columns except the last one (target variable 'class').
# 4. The final imputed DataFrame will have the missing values replaced with the mean of their respective columns.


# 2. SimpleImputer with median strategy
median_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
df_median_imputed = df.copy()
df_median_imputed.iloc[:, :-1] = median_imputer.fit_transform(df_median_imputed.iloc[:, :-1])
print("\nDataFrame after median imputation:")
print(df_median_imputed.head())

# Explain me this median stategy how it works step by step
# 1. Calculate the median of each feature (column) in the dataset, ignoring the missing values.
#    For example, for the 'plas' column, the median is calculated as:
#    median_plas = 122.68 (the middle value when the values are sorted)
#    (Note: The missing value is ignored in the calculation)

# use of sklearn.naive_bayes library explain in details
# sklearn.naive_bayes is a module in the scikit-learn library that provides a collection of algorithms for Naive Bayes classification tasks. It includes algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Complement Naive Bayes. By using sklearn.naive_bayes, we can easily implement and evaluate Naive Bayes models for various machine learning tasks, allowing us to quickly prototype and test our models.
# Naive Bayes algorithms are particularly useful for problems where the features are conditionally independent given the target variable, making them a popular choice for text classification and spam detection tasks. They are also easy to interpret and visualize, making them a popular choice for many machine learning applications. Overall, sklearn.naive_bayes is a powerful tool for building and evaluating Naive Bayes models in machine learning.
# It is particularly useful for automating the process of model evaluation and comparison, as it allows us to easily compute and visualize the performance of different models on a common set of metrics. By using sklearn.naive_bayes, we can ensure that our machine learning models are built in a consistent and efficient manner, improving the overall performance and reliability of our results.
# sklearn.naive_bayes can also help to improve the interpretability of the model by providing a clear representation of the Naive Bayes structure and its relationships with the target variable. Overall, sklearn.naive_bayes is a powerful tool for building and evaluating Naive Bayes models and improving their performance.
