PATCH HTTP Request: Unlike PUT Request, PATCH does partial update e.g. Fields that need to be updated by the client, only that field is updated without modifying the other field.

So in the previous example, we have to send only the name and email field in the request body.

{
"first_name":"Geeky",    // field that to be updated
"email":"hello@geeky.com",     // field that to be updated
}

Where non static variables are stored in Java?

Image result for where static variables are stored in java


What is hascode : hashCode() is used for bucketing in Hash implementations like HashMap, HashTable, HashSet, etc.
The value received from hashCode() is used as the bucket number for storing elements of the set/map. This bucket number is the address of the element inside the set/map.

What is custom Exception in java :  https://www.baeldung.com/java-new-custom-exception
1) Custom Checked Exception:
Checked exceptions are exceptions that need to be treated explicitly.

Let’s consider a piece of code that returns the first line of the file:

try (Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(fileName))) {
    if (file.hasNextLine()) return file.nextLine();
} catch(FileNotFoundException e) {
    // Logging, etc 
}
The code above is a classic way of handling Java checked exceptions. While the code throws FileNotFoundException, it's not clear what the exact cause is — whether the file doesn't exist or the file name is invalid.

To create a custom exception, we have to extend the java.lang.Exception class.
Let’s see an example of this by creating a custom checked exception called IncorrectFileNameException:

public class IncorrectFileNameException extends Exception { 
    public IncorrectFileNameException(String errorMessage) {
        super(errorMessage);
    }
}

2) Custom Unchecked Exception{
In our same example, let's assume that we need a custom exception if the file name doesn't contain any extension.

In this case, we'll need a custom unchecked exception similar to the previous one, as this error will only be detected during runtime.

To create a custom unchecked exception, we need to extend the java.lang.RuntimeException class:

public class IncorrectFileExtensionException 
  extends RuntimeException {
    public IncorrectFileExtensionException(String errorMessage, Throwable err) {
        super(errorMessage, err);
    }
}

}


Static block :
 Java supports a special block, called static block (also called static clause) which can be used for static initializations of a class. This code inside static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory. For example, check output of following Java program.
 // filename: Main.java
class Test {
	static int i;
	int j;
	
	// start of static block
	static {
		i = 10;
		System.out.println("static block called ");
	}
	// end of static block
}

class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {

		// Although we don't have an object of Test, static block is
		// called because i is being accessed in following statement.
		System.out.println(Test.i);
	}
}

static block called 
10
Also, static blocks are executed before constructors. For example, check output of following Java program.
If a class has static members that require complex initialization, a static block is the tool to use. Suppose you need a static map of some kind (the purpose is irrelevant here). You can declare it in-line like this:

public static final Map<String, String> initials = new HashMap<String, String>();
However, if you want to populate it once, you can't do that with an in-line declaration. For that, you need a static block:

public static final Map<String, String> initials = new HashMap<String, String>();
static {
    initials.put("AEN", "Alfred E. Newman");
    // etc.
}

Technology Stack for Cross-Platform Apps
React Native
React Native is a JavaScript framework built by Facebook, Inc. for developing mobile apps with native visualization for iOS, Android, WEB. The main feature of React Native is that it lets programmers use the same code to run both iOS and Android apps. The combo of the JavaScript library and React’s UI paradigm allows responsive applications to interact with native APIs and consequently keeps the development team productive. The framework offers new and radical tools for building robust applications with an intuitive user interface. This programming tool is considered to be the most efficient way to create cross-platform applications due to its wider acceptance and mature market presence.
