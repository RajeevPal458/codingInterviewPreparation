java 10 Features -----

1) local varriable type inference dynamic typed var used for only local varriable
 {

	var name = "rajeev" ;  no need to give type here it identified autometically
	
	var type can't use in method param and in return type
}

2) Optional class 'orElseThrow'  method
3) List.copyOf() ,Set.copyOf() ,Map.copyOf() methods create new Collection instances from existing instances
4) new methods toUnmodifiableList() , toUnmodifiableSet() ,toUnmodifiableMap() added to Collectors class in the stream package

The most notable changes involved an introduction of local-variable-type-inference(var), Garbage Collector interface, G1 improvements (parallel full GC), and application class-data sharing.

Among other stuff, we received new handy Collectors to be used with unmodifiable collections:
