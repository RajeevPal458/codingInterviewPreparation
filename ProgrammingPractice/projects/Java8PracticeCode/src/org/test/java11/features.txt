Java 11 (LTS)
Java 11 was the first Long-Term-Support release and featured 17 JEPs.

The most notable changes involved the addition of HTTPClient, Flight Recorder, experimental low-pause garbage collector(ZGC), and an experimental no-op garbage collector(Epsilon). Additionally, Java EE and CORBA modules got removed, and Nashorn deprecated.

We also got a tiny addition to Optional API: isEmpty(), which is the opposite of isPresent().

And a few interesting methods in String API:

isBlank
lines
repeat
strip
stripLeading
stripTrailing
Release date: 25 September 2018
