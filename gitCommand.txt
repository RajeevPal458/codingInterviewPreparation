How to recover repo from git if deleted from local 

1) You need to initialize a new Git repository in your machine:
$git init

2) Add your remote repository (published on GitHub):
$git remote add origin https://github.com/exampleusername/example_repo.git

3) fetch the origin:
$git fetch

4) Then you can update your local branch with any branch you want:
$git pull origin example_branch_name_you_want_to_take_update_from

5) Or you can simply clone the existing remote repository as suggested in the above comments:
$git clone https://your_repot_url

While using git add command I was receiving below error.

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in ansible.cfg.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory

git config core.autocrlf true
